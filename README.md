# addressBook
I am very tired. I wish I started last week.
I have changed the parameters for list_contacts in the header file. I couldn't for the life of me understand what TITLE was for.What are the encode files for???


Things left to work on:

  get_option (it only returns int, so please don't compare it with chars) 
  get_option is supposed to be able to comapre with NONE, CHAR, & INT which are all in the address_book_menu.h
  if you don't believe me go to the get_option function and look at the comments it literally says its meant to read
  numbers and characters. also if you look at the skeleton code there were various times the original code used it to 
  read a character.
  
  fix list contacts to show 5 entries per page (real annoying)
  
  fixing add_contacts
  
  all menus must loop back according to the documentation (just make a do while loop)
  
  lots and lots of debugging
  
  testing with csv file
  
  film output in a youtube video
