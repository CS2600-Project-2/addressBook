I am very tired. I wish I started last week.
I have changed the parameters for list_contacts in the header file. I couldn't for the life of me understand what TITLE was for.What are the encode files for???


Things left to work on:
  get_option (it only returns int, so please don't compare it with chars)
  
  fix list contacts to show 5 entries per page (real annoying)
  
  fixing add_contacts
  
  all menus must loop back according to the documentation (just make a do while loop)
  
  lots and lots of debugging
  
  testing with csv file
  
  film output in a youtube video
